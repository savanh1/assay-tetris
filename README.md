# Assay Tetris
An educational browser game where Tetris blocks represent biomarker assays in translational science.

Each block represents a different **biomarker assay** used in translational science and pathology:

- **NGS** — broad variant profiling  
- **IHC** — protein localization  
- **RNA-seq** — gene expression  
- **Spatial** — contextual analysis  
- **Imaging** — morphology and structure  
- **FISH** — amplifications/fusions  
- **qPCR** — targeted DNA/RNA detection  

As you clear lines, you’ll see **tips** about how assays complement each other in a translational pipeline.

## 🎮 How to Play
- **Desktop**:  
  - ← / → move  
  - ↑ rotate  
  - ↓ soft drop  
  - **Space** hard drop  
  - **C** hold piece  
  - **P** pause  
  - **R** restart  

- **Mobile**: On-screen buttons (Left, Right, Rotate, Down, Drop).

## 🖥️ Run Locally
1. Download `index.html`
2. Open it in any modern browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)

## 🌐 GitHub Pages
When uploaded to GitHub with Pages enabled, the game will be playable at:
